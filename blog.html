                        <p align="justify">With no poverty line and minimum wage in Kenya it can be
                            challenging to measure and identify people who struggle to make ends

                            In 2018, Lien Centre published a report <a style="color: blue;"

                        </p>

                            The report also makes recommendations on how these gaps might be filled
                            for a smoother and targeted food support distribution system. <br>
                            In 2019, PEAL-Kenya decided to probe deeper into the topic of food
                            insecurity.

                            70% of Kenyans households experienced food insecurity at
                            least once in the last 12 months. Being food insecure can also be
                            associated to having negative effects on a person’s physical and mental
                            health.

                                Food needs to be processed and packaged for transportation to retailers. This step of the food cycle has the highest level of waste in the developed world at 43 per cent.  Evolving to reduce this percentage while keeping food from degradation during the process is an ongoing challenge. This requires new, more efficient processing technologies and the recovery of food by-products . The use of recycled, edible, or biodegradable packaging also helps to protect the environment and create a more sustainable food-processing system.

                                Transportation ensures that food makes it from farms and manufacturers to retailers, such as grocery stores. Shortening the distance food needs to travel by supporting local production reduces emissions and creates a more sustainable system. However, to ensure the availability of food in all circumstances, it is essential to have transportation plans in place for instances when local food production faces challenges. Access to produce from foreign climates also provides a greater variety of nutritious and culturally diverse food.

                                Supermarkets, convenience stores, independent grocers, and farmers’ markets are all examples of retailers that sell food. People rely on these businesses to provide them access to the food they need, and having diverse, affordable options within reach is a vital aspect of food security. Sustainable practices can also be implemented at a retail level, by reducing amounts of plastic and food waste. Encouraging the use of reusable grocery bags, donating near-expired products, and even composting at a store level can help achieve this.

                                Food is a requirement of life, but the type of food consumed matters. Proper nourishment means having strong bodies and sharp minds. Nutrition education and access to healthy choices is vital to supplying us with the daily needs necessary to support a healthy lifestyle. Religious, medical, and ethical factors are also important. Enough options need to be available for those with dietary restrictions. Likewise, for quality of life, people should have choice and access to food they enjoy. What’s common to eat in one country
                                might not be common in another.For instance, insects are not as widely as consumed in Kenya as they are in other countries.

                                Food that isn't consumed is disposed off through waste management  systems.Compost is one way that organic waste can be  managed in a suitable way, using old food to fertilize new production, however food security aims to limit foodwastes in areas of abundance surpluses to areas where Hunger is still a concern.
